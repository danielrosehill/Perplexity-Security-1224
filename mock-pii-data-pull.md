# Adding Mock PII Data

This command adds as a Github submodule a collection of synthetic, personally identifiable information (PII) data that was itself generated by a large language model. 

The marked data generated and gathered in the repository was intended to simulate the type of user data that could credibly be uploaded to a large language model in the course of ordinary use. 

It includes a mock resume containing A address and phone number, as well as more programmatically oriented fake PII data such as scripts containing API keys in plain text.
